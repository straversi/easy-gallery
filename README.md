# easy-gallery
A compact javascript library for creating an image gallery.

Size: 3.1KB

## Usage

The parameter `true` in the constructor specifies that I'm taking advantage of Imgur's url sizing format.

Imgur's styling format means that in my markup, I include a `b` at the end of each image URL. Imgur serves a thumbnail. Easy-gallery will include remove the `b` when an image is expanded, loading the full size image.
```javascript
var firstGallery = new Gallery("image-group-1", true);
```
```html
<img class='image-group-1' src='http://i.imgur.com/3gBHbzEb.png'>
<img class='image-group-1' src='http://i.imgur.com/PvHMW7fb.png'>
<img class='image-group-1' src='http://i.imgur.com/Lwxrv1db.png'>
<img class='image-group-1' src='http://i.imgur.com/Y8ufw56b.png'>
